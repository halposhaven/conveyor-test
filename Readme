This repo controls the pod that acts as the file server for conveyor access

To add a new cleaner:

1) add a line to config-list.conf with the format of "$USER conveyor $PASS $DIR"
2) update smb.conf adding a configuration block of the format:
  [SHARE-NAME]
        comment = A description, cleaner name should go here
        path = /data/share/$DIR
        valid users = $USER
        public = no
        writable = yes
